      <p class="Introduction">
        Penthouse tells the story of wealthy families living in Hera Palace and their children at Cheong-ah Arts School.

        Shim Su-ryeon (Lee Ji-ah) is an elegant, wealthy woman who has a tragic past. Her husband is Joo Dan-tae (Uhm Ki-joon), a successful businessman. She later learns that he is hiding something from her.
        
        Oh Yoon-hee (Eugene) comes from a humble family background. She has had bad blood with Cheon Seo-jin (Kim So-yeon) since high school. She is a famous soprano whose father is the head of Cheong-ah Arts School. They get involved in a love triangle relationship with Ha Yoon-cheol (Yoon Jong-hoon).
        
        All of them have grand ambitions and desires for their children and would do anything for them. However, their lives begin to crumble as a young mysterious woman named Min Seol-ah (Jo Soo-min) crashes to her death during a party at Hera Palace. While the Hera Palace residents try to cover up the fact that she died on the premises, they cannot help but suspect each other for the murder.
